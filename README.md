Wake Forest 2025 Hackathon (2nd place with everyone, 1st place undergrad)

The purpose of this project was to be able to identify if a person was drunk from their face. The goal was to help prevent drunk driving. The hope is that parents could ask their child for a photo before driving home and then use this to determine if it is safe for them to drive home or if further investigation would be necessary.
