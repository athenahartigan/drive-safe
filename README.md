Wake Forest 2025 Hackathon - This project was created by Athena Hartigan and Tyler Passyn. It won 2nd place in the Hackathon when compared to every group and 1st place when only compared to undergraduates.

The purpose of this project was to be able to identify if a person was drunk from their face. The goal was to help prevent drunk driving. The hope is that parents could ask their child for a photo before driving home and then use this to determine if it is safe for them to drive home or if further investigation would be necessary.
